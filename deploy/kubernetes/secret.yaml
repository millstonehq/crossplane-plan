# NOTE: This deployment uses the same GitHub credentials as crossplane-provider-github
#
# The secret "github-creds" is already deployed in the crossplane-system namespace
# by the crossplane-provider-github application. No additional secret is needed.
#
# The secret contains a "credentials" key with base64-encoded JSON in the format:
# {
#   "app_auth": [{
#     "id": "APP_ID",
#     "installation_id": "INSTALLATION_ID",
#     "pem_file": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
#   }],
#   "owner": "millstonehq"
# }
#
# This secret is managed via SOPS encryption in:
# deploy/mgmt/prod/applications/crossplane-provider-github/secrets/
#
# If you need to deploy this independently (e.g., for testing), you can create
# a test secret in the crossplane-provider format or use the simpler token format:
#
# Simple token format (for local dev/testing only):
# kubectl create secret generic github-creds \
#   --from-literal=credentials=$(echo -n '{"app_auth":[{"id":"APP_ID","installation_id":"INSTALL_ID","pem_file":"PEM_CONTENT"}],"owner":"OWNER"}' | base64) \
#   --namespace=crossplane-system
